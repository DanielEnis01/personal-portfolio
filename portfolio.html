                    The purpose of developing this portfolio website is to have a platform in which my software engineering journey can be reflected to others, for it documents my progress and growing experience. I intend for this website to be the first stepping stone on a long path to mastering full stack development.

                <h2>The Process</h2>

                <p>
                   I started this project with miminal knowledge regarding Javascript or HTML. Therefore, I used challenges, such as creating a project section or implementing a functioning roadmap, to build my experience with these languages that are vital to my development skillset. Each update of the website is logged into the changelog that can be found on the roadmap page. Piecing together sections of this website gave me an authentic learning experience with CSS, for it took many attempts to have the website perfectly alligned to the theme I had in mind. Although some features may be works in progress, this website was crucial to my understanding of core web development components.
